# Understanding-Database-Technologies

Week 1:
AIM- UNDERSTAND PARTITIONING AND INDEXING

- Create tables in multiple drives/folders.
- Partition a table to store individual partitions on different disks/drives/folders.
- Load at least a couple of thousand of tuples into a table.
- Review the execution plan of the queries.
- Create optimum number of indexes required. At least one composite index.
- Review the execution plan to confirm that creating indexes has improved the performance of the query.

Week 2:
AIM- UNDERSTANDING QUERY COMPILATION AND EXECUTION PLAN GENERATION

- Write SQL queries containing group by, order by, equi-joins, outer joins, Set operators, sub queries, correlated sub queries.
- Identify the potential performance bottlenecks by analyzing the execution plan.
- Rewrite the queries to improve the performance using the techniques learnt.
	Use case 1: SQL syntax using NOT IN
	Use case 2: SQL using UNION and confirming that selection criteria is pushed to the appropriate level
	Use case 3: Multi table join (minimum of 4 tables) – Review the join order of the tables
- Demonstrate performance improvement by comparing the execution plans.

Week 3:
AIM- WORKING WITH HETEROGENEOUS DATABASES AND DISTRIBUTED FRAMEWORKS

- Demonstrate a heterogeneous distributed query.
- Write a MapReduce program

Week 4:
AIM- UNDERSTANDING BASIC OPERATIONS WITH 3 TYPES (DOCUMENT, WIDE-COLUMNAR STORE, GRAPH) OF NOSQL DATABASES

- Create a database in MongoDB  or any document database and execute basic operations – insert, update, delete, aggregation
- Create a table in HBase or any columnar database and execute basic operations – create, insert, update, delete specific revisions
- Use movies database in Neo4J sandbox or any graph database and execute operations to insert a node, establish a relationship and retrieve related attributes

Week 5:
AIM- BUILD A MULTI-MODEL SOLUTION TO A REAL LIFE PROBLEM

- Problem description within the Week 5 directory.
